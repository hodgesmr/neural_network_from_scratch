    "The goal of this Notebook is to give a hands-on explanation of how Artificial Neural Networks work. I intentionally avoided frameworks like PyTorch or Tensoflow because I wanted to build a better understanding of what Machine Learning models actually are, what Neural Networks actually are, and how they can be made. This Notebook is a collection of information I wish I had when I began this journey. It touches on a little bit of the math, but I don't deeply re-explain the math. I try to link out to more explanatory sources where I think it's valuable. Note: I am not a Machine Learning engineer, nor am I a Data Scientist. I'm a Software Engineer that turned into a political operative (lol). I wrote this for an audience of Software Engineers. Also: I don't have a GPU and I don't want to spend a bunch of money renting one from Amazon. This model can be trained and deployed on a modern CPU in a matter of minutes."

    "\n",
    "We're going to build a Neural Network for multi-class classification. All that means is we're going to make a model takes in images and attempts to label them from a set of options. In our case, we're going to create a Neural Network that works with the [MNIST database of handwritten digits](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This database contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, 0 - 9, and corresponding labels of which digit the handwritten image is. We'll use 60,000 of the images to train our Neural Network, and 10,000 to test its accuracy. I've included the data with this Notebook in the `data/` directory.\n",

    "### Shape of a Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let's demystify one thing: Neural Networks are just graphs. Just nodes and edges. If you've studied any Computer Science or have a background in Software Engineering, this is probably a familiar conecpet to you. The exact shape of any given Neural Network is dependant on how you build it, but that's something we get to decide. The graph has an **input layer** that is usually one node per input feature. In our case, **a pixel of an image is a feature**. Next, there are one or more **hidden layers**. Hidden layers are simply nodes in the graph that are in the middle. They take inputs from other nodes, and the give outputs to other nodes. This is the part that makes it Deep Learning. The presence of one or more hidden layers is the \"deep\" in Deep Learning. There's no standard rule for the size of a hidden layer, or how many you should have. Finally, there's an **output layer**. Each node in the output layer corresponds to one label. For example, if a possible label to an image is \"cat\" then one node in the output layer represents \"cat\". We're going to make a Neural Network that has a bunch of input layer nodes, a single hidden layer with ten nodes, and an output layer with ten nodes, one for each digit 0 - 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Nueron (node) has a unique **Weight** and **Bias**, and each layer has an **Activation Function**. The Activation Function defines the output of a neuron given its inputs, and does not change. We'll talk more about Activation Functions below. As we train our model, we adjust the Weights and Biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's are drawing of a Neural Network with three input nodes, a hidden layer with four nodes, and an output layer with two nodes. This might be how you'd construct a Neural Network that does binary classification: a model that tries to label inputs to one of two options for outputs.\n",

    "### How the Neural Network Learns\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks start out very stupid. As we'll see, they begin with no more \"intelligence\" than random guessing. Our goal is to **iteratively adjust the network's Weights and Biases** to make it smarter. This is called **training** and we do it in two steps: **Forward Propagation** and **Back Propagation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this step as showing the Neural Network some input, and asking it to classify it. At the beginning, it's very likely to get it wrong. But, like humans, we need to get things wrong before we know how to get them right. In Forward Propagation, we simply push all our features (pixels) through the Neural Network and ask, \"what did you see?\" The output is all the answers to that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Back Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this step as showing the Neural Network how right or wrong its answers were. We take all its answers to, \"what did you see?\" and come up with a measure of how wrong it was. We assign a numeric value to the \"how wrong was it?\" question with a [cost function](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/cost-function-in-machine-learning). From that numerica value, we can work backwards on all the neurons (nodes) to tell them, \"you were X wrong, and this specific neuron contributed to Y amount of that error; adjust this neuron's Weights and Biases by Z amount and try again.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3Blue1Brown has another excellent video on the conecepts of Back Propagation: \"[What is backpropagation really doing?](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/backpropagation)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! Our Neural Network learns by repeatedly making guesses, seeing how wrong it was, and adjusting its Weights and Biases. We repeat this over and over until it is good at the task! This is a lot like how people learn. Show a small child pictures of various farm animals over and over and ask them to name the animals. At first they're very bad at it, but over time they get very good at it. There's a lot of research out there that our artifical Neural Network is structured and operates like human brain neurons."

    "### Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is the most math-y piece of all this. Again, 3Blue1Brown has a great video: \"[Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gradient-descent)\". This is the piece that is the most _choose-your-own-adventure_ for how much you want to actually understand. I recommend diving in at least a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine being at a point graph and you want to find which step to take to get to the minimum value. If you've taken any calculus before, you know that you can take the slope at the current point to tell you which way the graph is trending, and by how much. If you do this over and over, with small steps, you will approach a local minimum. That's a 1-dimensional gradient descent. Our plan is to work with lots of repeated steps to get to a minumum of our [cost function](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/cost-function-in-machine-learning) — the function telling us how bad our predictions are.\n",

    "You can do this in two and three domensions as well. In fact, you can do it in as many dimensions as you need, which is very handy, because image classification has lots of dimensions. Imagine a color image. Its obvious dimensions are the pixel's X value, Y value, Red value, Green value, Blue value, alpha value, and probably many more.\n",

    "As mentioned, we're going to be working with the MNIST database of handwritten digits. This is a very handy beginner's data set because it's done a lot of the upfront work for us. First of all, the data is normalized: **all images are 28 x 28** and **grayscale**. The standard size is particularly helpful because we're going to need that to set up the input layer of our Neural Network. In other situations, you'd have to crop or squash or letterbox your images to make them a standard size. This is mostly boilerplate, but some details of the file format that you may wish to know:\n",

    "We're almost ready to train our model. The last piece here is to actually update our Weights and Biases after Back Propagation. You may be tempted to simply subracts the differences returned by `back_prop` but it's not quite so simple. Remember, our Gradient Descent is good at telling us the slope at our current location, but it's very unlikely to be a straight line. Instead, we're going to want to take smaller steps so that we don't over-shoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to introduce a variable called `learning_rate`, sometimes called **alpha**. This is a [hyperparameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)), which simply means that our model can't learn the correct value through training; we have to set it ourselves. There are techniques to make this process more efficient, but usually it's a bit of guess and check. If your model has a very bad time improving, you should try adjusting your learning rate. Common learning rates are between 0.01 and 1. If you'd like to read more about picking a learning rate, [this is a good post](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through some trial and error, I found that a learning rate of 0.5 worked pretty well for this model."

    "Now we have the Weights and Biases for our Neural Network to achieve 90% accuracy against our training data. That's pretty cool, but the real test to to run images through the model that it's never seen before. If we overfit the model, it might only be good at recognizing the images it was trained on (kindof like cramming for a test and memorizing the answers without actually learning anything). Let's run it against our 10,000 test images. At this point we only need to run it through `forward_prop` because we're no longer training. This is very fast!"

    "My first pass at tackling this topic began with Samson Zhang's \"[Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU)\". This Notebook looks a lot like his work, though I hit a number of implementation errors while following along. After digging into the articles and videos linked in this Notebook, I made a number of adjustments to the model's training to get to this final output."
